# SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the **SQL Data Warehouse  Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing solution using and SQL Server, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. It is designed as a portfolio project, highlighting industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.


## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

🎯 This repository is an great resource to showcase expertise in:
- SQL Development
- Data Architect
- Data Engineering  
- ETL Pipeline Developer  
- Data Modeling  
- Data Analytics

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture used in this project is the Medallion Architecture with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/DataArchitecture.png)
1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-it-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleaning, standardization,transformation, and normalization processes to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data which is modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 🛠️ Tools used:

- **[SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads):** Lightweight server for hosting your SQL database.
- **[SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16):** GUI for managing and interacting with databases.
- **[DrawIO](https://www.drawio.com/):** Design data architecture, models, flows, and diagrams.

## 🚀 Implementation steps:

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
These steps were followed to implement the project: 

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
